# prism-mob-vault-index

`prism-mob-vault-index` is a Go project for Mobile workflows. It turns create a Go reference implementation for vault workflows, centered on state machine modeling, transition tables, and invalid-transition tests into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Prism Mob Vault Index

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## What It Does

- Models local state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep sync pressure changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for form constraints, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents offline paths tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Design Sketch

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The Go layout uses small packages and table-oriented tests so the behavior stays easy to follow.

## Files Worth Reading

- `policy`: Go package with the core model
- `cmd`: small command entry point
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `go.mod`: Go module metadata

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Fixture Notes

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Limits

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Next Directions

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more mobile workflows fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
